## üîí Overview
CyberChat is an open-source, privacy-focused chat application designed for secure communication across both Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN). The application prioritizes user anonymity and ensures no persistent chat history is stored locally.

## ‚ú® Features
- Anonymous Communication: Chat without revealing identity or leaving traces
- Dual Network Support: 
  - LAN mode for local network communication
  - WAN mode for connecting to public IP servers
- No Data Persistence: Messages are not stored locally for maximum privacy
- Cross-Platform: Built with Qt for multi-platform compatibility
- Open Source: MIT licensed for transparency and community contribution
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- Language: C++
- UI Framework: Qt 6.5.3
- IDE: Qt Creator
- Build System: CMake
- License: MIT (Open Source)
  
## üìã Prerequisites
- Qt 6.5.3 or higher
- Qt Creator IDE

## üéØ Usage

### LAN Mode
- Launch CyberChat on devices within the same network
- One device acts as the server, others connect as clients
- Automatic device discovery on local network
  
### WAN Mode
- Configure one instance as a public server with accessible IP
- Clients connect using the server's public IP address
